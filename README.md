# Book O' Rama

This was a recurring assignment that I added upon every week throughout the semester I took the Web Development 2 course. The assignment was to create a bookstore, and so I created a bookstore called Book O' Rama. This website allows users to create a book reading list with goals, calculate the price of a magazine based on quantity, and subscribe to an e-mailing list.
